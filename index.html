	<p id="home">Villages are backbone of our country. They make ~70% of India's population and the percentage has been decreasing over years. Due to COVID, reverse migration is happening. Their development is essential for development of Nation and GDP growth.</p>

	<h2 id='religious institutions'>Religious Institutions</h2>

	<h2 id='autonomy'>Autonomy</h2>
	<p>
		Village Autonomy(Gram Swaraj) was conceived by Mahatma Gandhi who always stressed that villages should be independent, govern themselves and solve their own problems. Central and State Governments enacted different policies towards Gram Swaraj. Scheme by Central Government addressing this idea is <a href="http://gsa.nic.in/" target="_blank">Gram Swaraj Abhiyan</a> 
	</p>
	<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
	<p>
		Health is one of the most important Human Development Indicator. Villages have Primary Health Centres that give health care to all villagers. Health Care Workers reach each villager's homes for health checkups etc., Also, there are Mobile Hospitals, which can be reached by calling 104 Helpline.

	<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
	<p>
		Education of all levels from primary to higher should be available in villages itself. A Central Government Scheme <a href="http://www.ssa.nic.in/">Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan</a> aims to educate all the children between ages 6 to 14 by providing free education.
